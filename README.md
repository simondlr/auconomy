### Auconomy (Autonomous + Economy) ###

Enabling programs to better serve humanity

through the process of

streamlining the development of protocols and services that enable the functioning of autonomous agents.

---

In order for programs to interact without arbitrating trust through people, a host of services and protocols need to be developed.

The core of these protocols focus on Bitcoin's use as a decentralized 3rd-party arbiter, and it's capability as programmable money (enabling programs to transact on equal level to people).

An example is micropayment channels, which can act as an extended handshake, so that a client and server can transact with low-trust, and complete a service with recourse for both client and server.

Low-trust protocols:
- Low-trust protocol through extended handshake of payment channels.
- Decentralized identification:
- SIN (System Identification Number) ([Bitcoin wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Identity_protocol_v1))
- Fidelity Bonds/Passports through proof of sacrifice ([bitcoin wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Fidelity_bonds),[bitcointalk discussion](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=134827.0),[bitcointalk discussion](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=140711.0)).

Libraries that facilitate this:
- Bitcoinj ([Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/bitcoinj/)) (specifically the code on micropayment channels ([Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/bitcoinj/wiki/WorkingWithMicropayments))).

Micropayment prototypes in development:
- PayFile (allow downloading of files per kilobyte) ([Github](https://github.com/mikehearn/PayFile)).

Other projects that are of interest:
- Bitmessage (decentralized messaging) ([bitmessage wiki](https://bitmessage.org/wiki/Main_Page)).

- Low-trust renting of extra CPU cycles (paying through micropayment channels per cycle).
- Extension of low-trust protocols to non-digital realm.
